This workflow:
1. Performs security scans
2. Removes sensitive activation code files
3. Validates code quality
4. Creates deployment package
5. Uploads to GitHub releases
6. Provides deployment notifications
7. Verifies security measures

## 🎯 Final Deployment Steps

### 1. Make Repository Private
```bash
# Go to GitHub repository settings
# Set repository visibility to PRIVATE
# This protects activation codes from public access
```

### 2. Push Final Code
```bash
# Add all files including new documentation
git add README.md DEPLOYMENT.md .github/

# Create final commit
git commit -m "🚀 Final deployment - QuizYourFaith v2.0.0 Ready

✅ Complete multiplayer platform implementation
✅ Automatic chat clearing on user logout
✅ Seamless ZIP-based update system
✅ Comprehensive security measures
✅ Professional documentation
